My published work on speed and traffic density estimation in real time using work from the [Siamese Multi Object Tracking (SiamMOT)](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Shuai_SiamMOT_Siamese_Multi-Object_Tracking_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf) and achieves state of the art performance across diverse weather conditions. Demo videos can be found [here.](https://tufts.box.com/s/bsxwddo6g00y76wfcdof2lw9jdu59gm1)
